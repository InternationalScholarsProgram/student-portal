        <h5>Program Integrity and Termination</h5>
        <p>
          The International Scholars Program aims to assist you in a smooth and
          legitimate migration process to the United States as a graduate
          student. If it is discovered that you are using the program for

      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>Relocation Financing</h5>
        <p>
          Upon obtaining your visa, The International Scholars Program will NOT
          provide a loan to cover your relocation expenses. As a Prime Option
          student, your financial contribution will only cover the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>ISP Registration fees</li>
          <li>ISP Consultation fees</li>
          <li>Up to three school application fees</li>

          <li>SEVIS fees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please note that SEVIS fees will only be paid by ISP after your visa
          is issued. Should you be required to pay SEVIS fees before visa
          issuance, you must do so at your own expense. However, upon visa
          issuance, you will receive a credit in the exact amount of the SEVIS
          fee paid, which may be applied toward further expenses related to the
          Program.
