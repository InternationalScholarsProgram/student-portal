        The first step in this module is to submit a request to access the
        DS-160 instructions resource. This resource will guide you on how to
        complete your application for a student visa.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once you complete filling the DS-160, submit a request through this
        module to our team to review it. DO NOT submit your DS-160 to the
        embassy before it is reviewed by our team. Failure to adhere to this
        instruction may lead to your visa being denied.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once the review of your DS-160 is completed by our team, you will be
        granted access to the Visa interview appointment guidance resource in
        this module.
      </li>

      <li>
        Upon scheduling your visa interview appointment and getting a viable
        date, submit a request through this module to access visa interview
        training resources.
      </li>

      <li>
        When you are ready for a visa interview prep session with our team, you
        will be able to submit a mock visa interview request on this module.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once your mock visa interview request is granted, you will receive a
        notification on this module on when to attend the session.
      </li>

      <li>
        Immediately after attending the visa interview at the embassy, you MUST
        submit your visa interview transcript through this module regardless of
        the outcome. Failure to do so will hinder your progress to the next
        steps.
      </li>

      <li>
        In case of visa denial, request a visa advisory session in this module
        with our team for further guidance.
      </li>

      <li>Upon visa approval, proceed to the travel and logistics module.</li>
