      <li>
        The process of school admissions commences with submitting a career
        advisory request.
      </li>
      <li>
        You will receive an invitation for a meeting with the career advisory
        team who will assist you in selecting the most suitable courses and
        schools. After the meeting, the necessary sample documents for school
        applications will be available to you in this module. You must upload
        your documents in the specified format one by one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once your documents are verified, you will be able to submit a request
        to have our team start your school application, and the status of your
        application will be displayed throughout the process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon completion of the application for each of your schools, the school
        application portal link and login credentials will be displayed in this
        module along with any additional instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        For schools that have waived application fees, you will need to allow
        time for the waivers to be processed (timeline varies).
      </li>
      <li>
        Please note that there is no set timeframe for admission decisions from
        schools (typically 4-8 weeks on average), so please be patient.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any communication from the school regarding your application will be
        done via your official program email (the one we assigned you).
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you receive an admission decision for each of your application, you
        are required to submit the admission decision feedback through this
        module. If you have been accepted, you will receive a response from our
        team on the next steps of funding processing. In case you are denied,
        you will get an option to set up another career advisor meeting with our
        team, so that you can restart the school admission process.
